//! Optional types that translate to binding with better semantics in languages supporting them.
//!
//! Patterns are purely optional. If you want to use a certain pattern in your bindings
//! you generally define one or more functions that use some of the types contained in this module.
//!
//! Backends which support a pattern will then generate _additional_ language-specific helpers
//! and bindings  for it. In any case, regardless whether a pattern is supported by a backend or not,
//! fallback bindings will be available.
//!
//! ## Pattern Usage
//!
//! Unless otherwise stated patterns are used by, well, using them in signatures. For example,
//! instead of making `x` a type `*const u8` (or similar) in the following `print` function:
//!
//! ```
//! # use interoptopus::ffi_function;
//!
//! #[ffi_function]
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn print_ptr(x: *const u8) {
//!    // Write unsafe code to convert `x`
//! }
//!
//! ```
//!
//! you would instead accept an [`AsciiPointer`](crate::patterns::string::AsciiPointer):
//!
//! ```
//! # use interoptopus::ffi_function;
//! # use interoptopus::patterns::string::AsciiPointer;
//! # use std::ffi::CStr;
//!
//! #[ffi_function]
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn print_ascii(x: AsciiPointer) {
//!    // Call `x.as_str()` and handle Result
//! }
//!
//! ```
//!
//! This has the added benefit that any backend supporting a specific pattern will also
//! generate more **idiomatic code in the binding**. In the example above, C# might
//! emit a `ref ubyte` or `IntPtr` type for the `print_ptr`, but will use a correctly marshalled
//! `string` type for `print_ascii`.
//!
//!
//! ## Pattern Backend Support
//!
//! Patterns are exclusively **designed _on top of_ existing, C-compatible functions and types**.
//! That means a backend will handle a pattern in one of three ways:
//!
//! - The pattern is **supported** and the backend will generate the raw, underlying type and / or
//! a language-specific abstraction that safely and conveniently handles it. Examples
//! include converting an [`AsciiPointer`](string) to a C# `string`, or a [`service`](crate::patterns::service)
//! to a Python `class`.
//!
//! - The pattern is not supported and will be **omitted, if the pattern was merely an aggregate** of
//! existing items. Examples include the [`service`](crate::patterns::service) pattern in C which will not
//! be emitted. However, this will not pose a problem as all constituent types and methods (functions)
//! are still available as raw bindings.
//!
//! - The pattern is not supported and will be **replaced with a fallback type**. Examples include
//! the [`AsciiPointer`](string) which will become a regular `*const u8` in C.
//!
//! In other words, regardless of which pattern was used, the involved methods and types will always
//! be accessible from any language.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Some patterns have seen more testing (and documentation) than others. The ones
//! marked <sup>ðŸš§</sup> should be considered particularly work-in-progress.
