//! Convenience patterns like [services](crate::pattern::service), [strings](crate::pattern::string), [results](crate::pattern::result::Result) and [options](crate::pattern::option::Option).
//!
//! Patterns are optional types and constructs you can use. Most patterns are automatically applied
//! once you use their corresponding type.
//!
//! Backends which support a pattern will then generate _additional_ language-specific helpers
//! and bindings  for it. In any case, regardless whether a pattern is supported by a backend or not,
//! fallback bindings will be available.
//!
//! ## Pattern Usage
//!
//! For example, instead of accepting a `*const u8` (or similar) and returning `0` on success
//!
//! ```
//! # use interoptopus::ffi;
//!
//! #[ffi]
//! pub fn write_file(file: *const u8) -> i8 {
//!    let file = unsafe { /* ... */ };
//!    0
//! }
//!
//! ```
//!
//! you would instead accept an [`ffi::String`](crate::pattern::string::String) and return an [`ffi::Result`](crate::pattern::result::Result):
//!
//! ```
//! # use interoptopus::ffi;
//! #
//! # #[ffi]
//! # pub enum MyError {
//! #    Bad
//! # }
//!
//! #[ffi]
//! pub fn write_file(file: ffi::String) -> ffi::Result<(), MyError> {
//!    let file = file.as_str();
//!    ffi::Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! ```
//! That way you won't have to write `unsafe` code, _and_ you get more idiomatic code in most
//! backends. For example, in C# you might end up with a simple `WriteFile("foo.txt")` call
//! that automatically converts the used `string` to UTF-8, and in turn converts a failed result
//! to a CLR exception.
//!
//! ## Pattern Backend Support
//!
//! Patterns are exclusively **designed _on top of_ existing, C-compatible functions and types**.
//! That means a backend will handle a pattern in one of three ways:
//!
//! - The pattern is **supported** and the backend will generate the raw, underlying type and / or
//!   a language-specific abstraction that safely and conveniently handles it. Examples
//!   include converting a [`String`](crate::pattern::string::String) to a C# `string`, or a [`service`]
//!   to a Python `class`.
//!
//! - The pattern is not supported and will be **omitted, if the pattern was merely an aggregate** of
//!   existing items. Examples include the [`service`] pattern in C which will not
//!   be emitted. However, this will not pose a problem as all constituent types and methods (functions)
//!   are still available as raw bindings.
//!
//! - The pattern is not supported and will be **replaced with a fallback type**. Examples include
//!   the [`CStrPointer`](string) which will become a regular `*const char` in C.
//!
//!
//! # Pattern Composition
//!
//! Due to a lack of expressiveness in other languages, patterns usually compose without issues in Rust, but
//! not in all backends. For example, something like `Slice<Result<Option<String>, Error>>` is supported in
//! Rust without issues, but its UX might suffer in Python.
